Captain's Log 
Earth time: September 3, 3087
System: LTT 2667 ~ Approx. 166.46 LY from Diaguandri 
Lonely cold planets in this system. After accepting a job from Ray's Gateway in the Diagaundri system I find myself to feel very eerie in this system. This system's main fuel star is 
a nuetron star which created many complications when arriving here in my Type 6 Logistics ship as I believed that this star would not have a strong gravitational force due to it's
size however, I was forced to disengage my supercruise as this star mass locked my ship for a few hours. Now I venture back towards a small colony on one of it's planets to deliver large sums of gold, cobalt, and copper soon to be used for technological equipment.
