Captain's Log 
Earth time: October 25th, 3098
System: CD-73 12 ~ Approx. 178.31 LY from Diaguandri 
This system is in chaos. Away from Federation regulation's this system's government is independant. The government here is very cooperative as they welcomed me a member of the 
Federation bringing approximately 80 tons of refugee shelter building equipment as all habitated settlements in these planetary systems are under civil unrest. 
The economies here are predominantly industrial and military in nature, the people here are frail and sickly in these parts. Let's hope that this independant faction could recover
proper aid from the federation and continue to help these people prosper!
