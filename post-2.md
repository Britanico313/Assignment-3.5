Captain's Log 

Earth time: October 25th, 3098

System: CD-73 12 ~ Approx. 178.31 LY from Diaguandri 

This system is in chaos. Away from Federation regulation's this system's government is independant. The government here is very cooperative as they welcomed me a member of the Federation bringing approximately 80 tons of refugee shelter building equipment as all habitated settlements in these planetary systems are under civil unrest. The economies here are predominantly industrial and military in nature, the people here are frail and sickly in these parts. Let's hope that this independant faction could recover proper aid from the federation and continue to help these people prosper!

Many other ships have been told to be weary of pirating ships that can scan cargo and steal goods. I recommend all pilots be weary here as the agression of rebels rises. If I were to bring high value goods here I would probably have a friend of mine Commander Noah, follow me in a attack vessel to keep safe.
